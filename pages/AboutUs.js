                            <p>Vince Policella Sr. was born in a small village in Italy and was trained as a skilled mason.  Shortly after immigrating to Canada in 1964, he began a family and started his own business. In 1984, after 15 successful years in masonry, Vince Sr. followed his dream and the business evolved into Policella Homes.  In 2001, Vinceâ€™s son completed an Honours Business degree from Brock University, joined the family business and a successful partnership was created.
